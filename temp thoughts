need to edit doublebootstrap the same way i edited bootstrap
  it needs to see the strata, calc the size, use the size to build the structure
  should be similar because the doubleBoostrap will have same size and structure as first bootstrap
    can the info be used since bootstrap is being run first?


test: if a custom action is run within another custom action are the variables and output tables available for use?


Can bootstrap be broken into components
  functions or other actions?

Need for ccf:
  strata now: detects and calculates the size
  strata size as input: uses input table of strata|stata_n
  strata size variable: uses input table of strata|strata_n=-1|strata_dist (can this be string for input into rand function?)

idea: if i make variable strata_input...
  check if strata= is a column
    check if strata_input is a table
      if yes then use strata_input
      if no then calculate and use Bpct to adjust size
